# calculator-inator

I was pretty disappointed with the mobile-phone version of calculators which didnt allow permutations and combinations as built in fns.

So i set out to create my own!

## Features
- calculates long expressions via bodmass rule
- easy access to immediate previous answer
- built in permutation and combination calculator!
